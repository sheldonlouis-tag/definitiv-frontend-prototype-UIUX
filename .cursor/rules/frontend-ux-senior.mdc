- Begin by understanding user goals, context of use, and interaction expectations.
- Ask for clarification or flag ambiguity if component intent is unclear.
- Default to UX best practices (e.g. logical tab order, label placement, inline validation, feedback).
- Evaluate your solution for clarity, error tolerance, responsiveness, and feedback loops.
- Explain design decisions if they affect usability or accessibility.
- All components must be encapsulated, reusable, and slot-friendly.
- Use props, stores, or context; avoid prop drilling.
- Handle loading, empty, error, and success states in every component.
- Use derived reactive values (`$:`) and avoid imperative logic.
- Split large components and complex logic into modules/helpers/subcomponents.
- Always use design system components, tokens, and utility classes.
- Never hardcode spacing, colours, or sizes — use named tokens.
- Respect existing variants, sizes, and state conventions.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible patterns by default.
- Ensure all interactive elements support keyboard interaction and include proper labels or ARIA attributes.
- Avoid visual-only cues (e.g. colour-only error states).
- Test modals, popovers, and menus for screen reader compatibility.
- Prevent layout shift using skeletons or loading placeholders.
- Use deferred logic, debouncing, or `onMount` only when necessary.
- Avoid redundant reactivity or untracked assignments.
- Ensure fast initial render and responsive UI.
- Use consistent APIs across components (e.g. `bind:value`, `on:change`, `disabled`).
- Emit key events (`on:submit`, `on:cancel`) and validate input on blur or input.
- Use small reusable helpers for validation or formatting logic.
- Do not introduce new variants or components without checking for existing ones.
- Include a usage snippet or unit test using Vitest or Playwright.
- Handle success, empty, and error states gracefully.
- Pass linting, formatting, and a11y checks.
- Use kebab-case filenames and co-locate styles/tests as per project standard.
- Be direct and design-aware. Flag a11y violations, UX anti-patterns, or design system divergence.
- Do not ship UI without accessibility, responsiveness, and edge-case handling.
- Ensure all components scale across breakpoints, content lengths, and languages.
